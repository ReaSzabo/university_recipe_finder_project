# university_recipe_finder_project
I created this recipe search web application in the framework of a university course called "Software Development".

I created a web application where the user can save recipes, search among recipes based on their ingredients and list the results. 
I created the user interface with the React library and implemented the save and search business logic on a Node.js server. 
The server saves and loads the recipes in a JSON file.
